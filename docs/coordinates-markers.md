# Coordinates and markers

* [Field](/docs/field.pdf)
* [Field corner markers](/docs/field-markers.pdf)
* [Red team markers](/docs/red-markers.pdf)
* [Blue team markers](/docs/blue-markers.pdf)

## Field

### Building the field

You can either:

* Print the [whole field](/docs/field.pdf)
* Print only the [corner markers](/docs/field-markers.pdf) to stick them on existing field

In the second case, this is where they are placed:

### Coordinates

The field coordinates are the following:

![Field coordinates](/docs/imgs/field-frame.png)

The frame's origin is the middle of the field, and robots orientation are angle formed by
field x axis and front of the robot.

Roughly, the coordinates of the blue robot above will look like *(x=0.4, y=0.4, alpha=45 deg)*.

## Robots

You can print [red]((/docs/red-markers.pdf)) and [blue](/docs/blue-markers.pdf) markers and
place them on the robots:

## Camera

The camera can be any USB camera that works with OpenCV, and it should be able to see the whole field
