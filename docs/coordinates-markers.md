# Coordinates and markers

* [Field](/docs/field.pdf)
* [Field corner markers](/docs/field-markers.pdf)
* [Red team markers](/docs/red-markers.pdf)
* [Blue team markers](/docs/blue-markers.pdf)

## Field

### Building the field

You can either:

* Print the [whole field](/docs/field.pdf)
* Print only the [corner markers](/docs/field-markers.pdf) to stick them on existing field

In the second case, this is where they are placed:

![Putting markers on existing field](/docs/imgs/field-markers-explain.png)

### Coordinates

The field coordinates are the following:

![Field coordinates](/docs/imgs/field-frame.png)

The frame's origin is the middle of the field, and robots orientation are angle formed by
field x axis and front of the robot.

Roughly, the coordinates of the blue robot above will look like *(x=0.4, y=0.4, alpha=45 deg)*.

## Robots

You can print [red](/docs/red-markers.pdf) and [blue](/docs/blue-markers.pdf) markers and
place them on the robots:

## Camera

The camera can be any USB camera that works with OpenCV, and it should be able to see the whole field

We recommend using [**Spedal MF920Pro, 1080p and 120Â° angle**](https://www.amazon.com/Spedal-Conference-Streaming-Microphone-Desktop/dp/B07TDQ8NL3)

To assemble the structure, you can use 50mm PVC pipes, and attach the camera with a Ziptie:

![Ziptie camera](/docs/imgs/camera_ziptie.png)

(here, zip tie is a 7.5 x 300mm)

## Markers

Markers are ArUco 4x4, you can use tool like [this one](https://chev.me/arucogen/), printed with a scale
of 8 cm. The ArUco ids are:

* 0: field corner 1
* 1: field corner 2
* 2: field corner 3
* 3: field corner 4
* 4: robot red 1
* 5: robot red 2
* 6: robot blue 1
* 7: robot blue 2
* 8-15: generic objects

## Ball

![Balls](/docs/imgs/balls.png)

For the ball, we use orange gold ball in PU (foam) material
