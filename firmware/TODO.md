# TODO

- Add a `start`/`stop` behaviour
  - `start` should enable the distance sensors and turn the leds white
  - `stop` should turn the leds red and prevent the robot from moving,
    and turning the distance sensors off
- Handle the optical sensors enable/disable
- Clean and comment the LEDs system
